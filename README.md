# Reconstructing-Obfuscated-Human-Faces
In pictographic media, OBSCURATION has long been a familiar fig leaf to cover our visual media’s most private parts. Blurred chunks of text or obscured faces and license plates show up on news, in redacted documents, and online. This obscurity procedure is done by removing details from the photos keeping in mind the end goal to lessen the distinguishing facial highlights. The problem, however, is that humans aren’t the only image recognition masters around anymore. As computer vision becomes increasingly robust, it’s starting to see things we can’t. These obfuscated images may still contain enough details such that the original features may be able to be recovered. We use machine learning techniques to output a reconstructed image of the person’s face.
Even though, every human face is different from the other we may still find similar patterns among them. Hence, by training our network on those patterns we can be able to regenerate the image.  In this project we will examine different neural networks to reconstruct obfuscated images of human faces.
